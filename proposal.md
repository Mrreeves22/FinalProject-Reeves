# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Currency Converter

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows you to easily convert different currencies.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My program will take in an amount of 1 selected currency and return the amount in a different currency. I plan to execute it by making an html, css, and JavaScript to not only function correctly but look the way I want it to. To select the currencies being converted, there will be a dropdown menu with various currencies. I hope to create a webpage to base this converter on for easy use.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

My project will convert popular currencies like USD and GBP from one to another, functional in an IDE.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I believe I can create a website accessible to anyone who has the link that supports at least 25 different currencies.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to create a website that supports as many currencies as possible and in their live worth using an API. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn many different things like HTML for the web aspect, CSS for the design aspect, and JavaScript for the conversion aspect. I hope to learn how to include an API in my program to support live data as well as find a way to include every currency in circulation. Since I am working alone, I will have to perform and learn all of these skills myself.
