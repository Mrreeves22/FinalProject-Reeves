Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created and started adding to the HTML and CSS files. I have figured out how to easily save my code to GitHub.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet addressed the JavaScript aspect of the website, or have figured out the full plan for the CSS designs.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The only problem I have ran into so far is getting my code to show up on GitHub.
